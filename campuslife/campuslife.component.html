      <p  style="margin-left: 650px; margin-top: -500px;">At the beginning of the twenty-first century, many colleges and universities have a broad educational mission: to develop the "whole student." On college campuses, extracurricular involvement is a key tool in this personal development. For the majority of college and university students, involvement in extracurricular activities plays an integral role in the collegiate experience. Students become involved in extracurricular activities not only for entertainment, social, and enjoyment purposes, but most important, to gain and improve skills.

        <button  style="margin-left: 50px;"><h1>Hostel facility</h1></button>
        <p  style="margin-left: 650px; margin-top: -500px;">Hostels thus serve as fit platforms for bringing together children from different backgrounds and giving them an opportunity to interact with each other, and learn about cultures other than their own. Sharing meals and stories in the hostel courtyard eventually boosts the sense of empathy among students.</p>
